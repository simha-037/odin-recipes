    <p>This roasted butternut squash feta pasta is a savory comfort food meal with rich flavors,<br> like Autumn in a bowl. Sweet roasted squash and sun-dried tomatoes contrast beautifully with the tangy feta cheese.</p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups  cubed, peeled, and seeded butternut squash (1/2-inch cubes)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) block feta cheese, preferably made with sheep’s milk</li>
        <li>10 ounces radiatore pasta, or any other small, shaped pasta</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sun-dried tomatoes, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage leaves</li>


    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>

        <li>Add cubed squash, 2 tablespoons olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper, and toss until evenly coated. Place feta block in center, and drizzle mixture with remaining oil.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender and feta is becoming creamy, 30 to 35 minutes, stirring a couple times.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta until tender with a bite, 8 to 9 minutes, or according to package instructions. Reserve 1 cup pasta water; drain pasta and set aside.</li>

        <li>Remove squash mixture from the oven. Gently break up feta and combine with squash, smashing slightly, and stir in the sun-dried tomatoes and sage.</li>

        <li>Add pasta to the baking dish, along with a splash of pasta water, and stir gently to create a creamy sauce. If pasta seems a bit dry, add a little pasta water until you reach your desired consistency. Hot pasta soaks up sauce as it sits, so if you plan to reheat leftovers, add just a little more pasta water.</li>

        <li> Taste, adjust seasoning if necessary, and serve warm.</li>
        

    </ol>
