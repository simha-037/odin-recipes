    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound (about 225g) of spaghetti or linguine</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>

        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced </li>

        <li>1/4 cup of reserved pasta water</li>

        <li>1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>

        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish, optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Pasta: Boil the pasta according to the package directions in salted water. Before draining, scoop out about a cup of the starchy cooking water and set it aside. Drain the rest of the pasta.</li>

        <li>Make the Sauce: In the same pot or a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant (don't let the garlic burn!).</li>

        <li>Combine: Add the drained pasta to the pot with the garlic butter. Toss to coat.</li>

        <li>Emulsify: Add about $1/4$ cup of the reserved pasta water to the pot. Stir or toss vigorously; the starch in the water will mix with the butter to create a light, creamy sauce. Add more pasta water a tablespoon at a time if the sauce is too thick.</li>

        <li>Finish: Stir in the Parmesan cheese (if using) and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately.</li>

    </ol>
