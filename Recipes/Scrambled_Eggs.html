    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of milk or cream (optional, for fluffiness)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of butter or a splash of oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the Eggs: Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add the milk/cream (if using), and a pinch of salt and pepper. Whisk vigorously until the yolks and whites are fully combined and slightly frothy.</li>

        <li>Heat the Pan: Place a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the butter/oil and let it melt until it coats the pan.</li>

        <li>Cook: Pour the egg mixture into the hot skillet</li>

        <li>Scramble: As the edges of the eggs begin to set (about 30 seconds), gently push the cooked egg from the edges toward the center, tilting the pan so the uncooked egg runs underneath. Repeat this process until the eggs are mostly cooked but still slightly moist.</li>

        <li>Serve: Remove from the heat immediately and transfer to a plate. They will continue to cook slightly from the residual heat.</li>
